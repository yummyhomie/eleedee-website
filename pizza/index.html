            I have a goal of making at least <span class="italic">one</span> pizza a month. Pizza making is a hobby I've done on and off throughout the years, but I want to get so much better. 
            <br></br> 
            This months pizza is one I've never attempted to make before! A cast-iron pizza.

            This pizza turned out to be <span class="font-bold">super</span> delicious! For the toppings I had salami (underneath the cheese), banana peppers & black olives. 
            I seasoned the sauce with some red-pepper flakes, oregano & thyme for that extra "kick."
            <br></br>
            My only complaint was that I still struggle with achieving the classic deep-dish pizza look.
            It was more like a regular pizza with thicker crust & not a lot of crispy-ness. I also struggle with getting the dough to stick onto the vertical edges of the pan, it tends to slide
            back down into the rest of the dough. 
            <br></br>
            Overall, it was still, a delicious pizza.
