        <p class="mb-4"> <!-- Intro -->
            I have a strong belief that full & complete data privacy is a <span class="font-bold">human right.</span> Unfortunately, serving you tailored ads is (apparently) more 
            important than recognizing that there is an invasion of privacy going on. 
            <br></br>
            On that note, I've used a calendar for years, it's an important tool for me. However, the thought of willingly handing over my schedule, full of tasks & family events
            to <span class="italic">big-tech</span> stirred an unpleasant feeling in me. I kid you not when I say that I would become livid when I'd set an event to attend graduation, 
            and later on receive ads for overpriced gowns/challenge coins/memorabilia. <span class="font-bold underline">It's NOT right.</span>
            <br></br>
            Give me a button to press to keep my life private and I will press it. If you're thinking, "But I have nothing to hide," I would encourage you read the 1st paragraph of 
            <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Privacy" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-600">The Right to Privacy</a> written in 1890, and reconsider
            your stance. It's not a matter of hiding, it's <span class="italic">"the right to enjoy life,—the right to be let alone;"</span>
            <br></br>
            So this afternoon I will show you how to self-host your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV"  target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-600">CalDAV</a>
            server at home using <a href="https://radicale.org/v3.html"  target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-600">Radicale</a>. With availability to read & edit events from the web or iphone!
            Keeping your calendar, tasks, notes & data on an environment YOU secure. 
            <br>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Just so you're aware, this is written in nix! My entire homelab uses strictly NixOS.
            Implementing this on your NixOS machine will setup the Radicale Server & the Radicale Web Client. Note that this does NOT setup port-forwarding. Please be safe and do
            your own research on the risks of opening up ports/services to the internet!
